# Road Accident Dashboard (2021-2022)

## Overview
This project aims to create a **Road Accident Dashboard** for the years **2021 and 2022** to provide insights into accident trends, severity, vehicle types involved, road conditions, and urban vs. rural distribution. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to analyze key patterns and improve road safety measures.


The dataset used in this project consists of accident records categorized by:
- **Year** (2021, 2022)
- **Month** (January - December)

- **Casualties by Road Type**
- **Casualties by Urban vs. Rural Areas**
- **Casualties by Daylight vs. Dark Conditions**

This project was created using **Excel** for data processing and visualization. The goal is to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that provides meaningful insights into road accident trends.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** for data cleaning and visualization

## Process 
- verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- created pivot tables according to the queations asked.
- merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply sclicer to make dynamic
